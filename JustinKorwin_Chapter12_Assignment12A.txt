This program will take a csv file with a bunch of names and grades for 3 exams and then put them into a numpy array.
Different statistics of all the exams will then be calculated and displayed.

Variables:
student_number
header
data
first_name
last_name
exam1
exam2
exam3
flattened_grades
grades
pass_grade
total_passed
total_failed
passed
failed
pass_percent

Functions:
student_data_collect (function not called because I already made the csv file but it is still in the code)
numpy_data

Logical Steps:
1. Copy and paste some of the code from the csv assignment to set up the initial csv file
2. Create a numpy_data function that puts all the data into a numpy array
3. Use the various functions numpy offers to calculate and display the mean, median, standard deviation, min, and max of
	the three exams in one easy step
4. Do the same thing as step 3 but will all the exams combined using .flatten
5. Create an iterator that goes through and finds all the passing exams with the determined pass_grade variable
6. Add up all the passing and failing exams as a total and print how many passes and fails there are in total
7. Use the total passes and fails to create a variable that is the percent of passes to total tests
