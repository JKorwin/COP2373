This program will search an email message inputted by the user for various different phrases or words. These phrases or words are 
commonly found in spam email messages. The total number of phrases or words present in the email will determine the likelihood
that the message is spam. Then the total number of phrases or words found, the likelihood the message is spam, and the words
and phrases that were found will be displayed to the user.
