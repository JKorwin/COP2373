This program will ask for a number of expenses from the user. The expenses will be analyzed for the lowest expense,
the highest expense and the total expense. These will then be displayed back to the user

variables:
list_of_expenses
expense
expense_name
expense_amount
expenses_sum
highest_expense
lowest_expense


functions:
an expense_list function that asks the user for different expenses and saves the expenses as a tuple in a list
a min_max function that finds the minimum and maximum expenses (will have to look at the second element of the tuple)
a sum_expenses function that adds all the expenses together
a main function that calls on the three previous functions and then prints the results of the min_max function and the sum_expenses function

logical steps:
1. Create the expense_list function that asks the user for a set of expenses
2. Create a function that adds the number part of the list of tuples to find the sum of the expenses
3. Create the min_max function that finds the biggest and smallest expense
4. Create a main function that combines all of the previous functions and prints the sum, minimum expense, and maximum expense
   in good format back to the user
5. Call on the main function
6. Remember to use tuples so that the minimum and maximum expenses can be displayed back to user labeled
