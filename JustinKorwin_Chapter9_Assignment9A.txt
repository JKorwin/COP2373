This program will create a class named BankAcct that will store the name, account number, balance, and interest rate
for a bank account. Methods for changing the interest rate, calculating the amount of interest, withdrawing, depositing, and seeing the balance will be created and then tested using a test function.

Variables:
name
account_number
amount
interest_rate
interest_amount
account
amount_withdraw
amount_deposit
balance
days
interest

Functions:
A test function that uses all the methods in the class to ensure all of them are working 

Logical Steps:
1. Create a class named BankAcct and initialize name, account number, amount and interest rate.
2. Create methods for adjusting the interest rate, withdrawing, depositing, getting the balance and calculating interest
3. Make a test function that asks user for name, account number, amount and interest rate
4. Allow user to input an adjusted interest rate and then print the account balance and interest rate to ensure it is working
5. Repeat step 4 for withdrawing, depositing, and calculating interest
