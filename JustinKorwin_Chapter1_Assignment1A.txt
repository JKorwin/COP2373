This program will pre-sell a limited number of cinema tickets and display the number of buyers at the end.

variables:
number_of_tickets
number_of_buyers
tickets_bought

functions:
a function that subtracts the number of tickets bought from the total number of tickets
an accumulator function that adds 1 to the total number of buyers after each iteration of a while loop

Logical Steps:
1. Establish that there are 20 total tickets and 0 total buyers at the beginning
2. Create a loop that prompts the user to enter the number of tickets they would like to buy 
   as long as there are greater than 0 tickets left
3. Establish if statements for if the user is trying to buy a prohibited amount of tickets
4. Inside the loop will be a function to subtract the amount of tickets the user bought
   and an accumulator to add to the number of buyers
5. The number of tickets left will be displayed
6. After all the tickets have been bought I will display total number of buyers
