This code will allow for student names and exam grades to be written as a csv file.
This file will then be read and the information will be displayed in a tabular format

Variables:
header
data
first_name
last_name
exam1
exam2
exam3
csv_writer

Functions:
student_data_collect
data_read

Logical Steps to Program:
1. Import CSV so this all actually works
2. Create the student data collect function and ask for the number of students whose data will be collected
3. Create a list called header that includes all of the different types of data that will be collected
4. Create a list named data that begins as just the header
5. Use a loop and the number of students gotten before to ask for the set of data needed the amount of times needed
6. After one set of data is gotten, it will then be appended to the data list that was created.
7. After the data is appended to the list it is then written to the grades.csv file as a row using writerows
8. All the data should now be collected
9. Create the function that will first open the file and create the reader
10. Take all the data read from the reader and convert it into a data list similar to before because lists are awesome
11. Print the first line element by element with ample space in between because this is the header
12. Use a loop to print the rest of the rows in the list element by element with the same amount of space in between as the header
13. Don't forget to call the functions and pray it all works
