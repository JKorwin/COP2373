This program will calculate the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle when given the nearest angle in degrees
and the length of the adjacent side.

Variables:
angle
radians
length
hypotenuse

Functions:
main

Logical Steps:
1. Ask user for the nearest angle in degrees and the length of the adjacent side
2. Convert degrees to radians because math.cos has to use radians
3. Use length / math.cos(radians) to find the length of the hypotenuse
4. Display the length of the hypotenuse
