This program will use the inheritance approach found in 10.12 to create a class definition of Money that will
support addition, subtraction, and multiplication. A test function will be created to test these methods.

Variables:
result1
result2
result3  (these are used to test if the methods are working right)
money1
money2   (instances of the money class)

Functions:
test function to ensure methods are working correctly

Logical Steps:
1. Copy and past the inheritance code found in 10.12 to start the definition of the Money class
2. Add an addition method that returns the value of one instance of money added to another instance of money
3. Add a subtraction method that returns the value of one instance of money subtracted by another instance of money
4. Add a multiply method that returns the value of one instance of money multiplied by a number
5. Create a test function that creates two instances of money and runs all the methods and saves them to a variable
6. Print the variables created in step 5 to ensure they are all working properly
